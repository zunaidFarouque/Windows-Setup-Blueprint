## Typing and text workflow

For CopyQ, you have to specify the WinMerge.exe location in the direct diff command.

WinMerge settings I use:

- Compare > General: moved block detection on, align similar lines on, diff algorithm `minimal`, indent heuristic on.
- Editor > Compare/Merge: copy granularity `Char`, view line differences on, line difference coloring character-level.
