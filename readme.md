# Windows 10 Setup Blueprint

A comprehensive, organized repository of runbooks, settings, scripts, and software lists to rebuild a Windows 10 environment from scratch.

## What this repo is for

- Capture **exact tools and configs** you use across fresh installs.
- Provide **step‑by‑step runbooks** so you can go from bare Windows → fully tuned workstation without guesswork.
- Make everything **browsable from GitHub / GitHub Pages** via simple markdown links.

## Browsing on GitHub / GitHub Pages

All links above are **relative paths inside this repo**, so they work both on:

- The main GitHub repository page.
- The GitHub Pages project site (project README renders as the landing page, and links drill into the same markdown files).

Use this `readme.md` as the starting index and follow links into each numbered folder for detailed setup instructions.
